# Work 
2022-01-04
## Prompt Questions
1) **Consider your favourite projects**: Think back to the work you did in the past year and reflect on the assignments or projects that felt challenging but energising. Jot down anything that comes to mind –– from on boarding a new team member to serving on a committee unrelated to your core role. Look for common themes to the kind of work you find most gratifying. Write out the action items it might take to experience more of those high moments in the new year, including any obstacles you might need to break through.
2) **Contemplate your biggest challenges**: Consider any professional challenges that made you unhappy, stood between you and a career goal, or simply made your job harder. This could be anything from a strained work relationship to an abundance of busy work. Write down how you might minimise or eliminate these challenges in the new year. Don’t limit your scope of solutions –– entertain the possibility of a new job or a new career path altogether.
3) **Think about your professional growth**: Our jobs (and by extension our days, weeks, and even years) get stale when we’re stagnant. Reflect on new skills you picked up in the past year or opportunities you had to stretch beyond your previous capabilities. If things stayed the same, consider whether that works for you or if it’s time to try out something new.

# Productivity
## Prompt Questions
1) **Consider your daily progress**: Think about how much you’re getting done each day. Review any daily to-do lists you have on hand, whether they’re from earlier this year or just the other day. Pay attention to what you wrote down versus what you actually got done. Consider whether you’re structuring your day in a way that helps you focus on your priorities and move towards your goals. If not, take our quiz to find a productivity method that works for you –– whether that’s time blocking, pomodoro, GTD, or something else entirely.
2) **Review your overall productivity**: The biggest indicator of productivity is what you actually got done. Take note of your biggest personal and professional projects. Write down the important things you got done this year. These could be big projects you launched at work, the effort you devoted to a side project, time dedicated to community organizing, or anything meaningful you accomplished and feel proud of.
3) **Assess your digital distractions**: Social media and online content can curtail our productivity and leave us with less time in a day. While Netflix and YouTube have their place in helping us unwind and enjoy entertainment, sometimes they distract and detract. Consider your time spent online over the last year. If your internet use veers toward excessive, think about the ways that time could be better spent. That doesn’t mean replacing your time on Twitter with work, but with activities that serve your bigger goals –– whether that’s baking with your kids or creating the comic book you’ve been thinking about for years.

# Health 
## Prompt Questions

Consider everything from your caffeine consumption to your alcohol intake. Note down nutritious foods you want to add more of to your diet and write down areas of improvement.
2) **Account for your workouts**: Review your workouts (or lack thereof). Highlight any PRs or activity results you’re proud of –– from trying out Yoga to going on a walk a few times a week. Try to spot any important trends, like working out less during a stressful month in your life or being more active during spring and summer. Use any new insights to inform the activity goals you set for the coming year. Think back to any injuries and whether you gave your body enough time to recuperate. Don’t forget to think about rest. Consider sleep levels and think about whether you’re waking up rested each day.
3) **Reflect on your mental health**: Think about how you coped with the stresses of life over the past year. Note whether you felt any sadness, anxiety, or anger and how you dealt with those emotions in both healthy and counterproductive ways.

## Prompt Questions
1) **Consider the most important people in your life**: Jot down the names of the people whose presence in your life you value, even if those relationships aren’t always easy. Consider whether you’ve spent enough time with them in the passing year, your favorite memories, biggest learnings, and ideas for spending more or better time with them in the new year. If relationships with any of these people are strained, think through the effort it might take to repair those bonds and whether it’s a worthwhile pursuit.
2) **Think about how you support your loved ones**: Relationships are a mutual dance of give and take. Consider how much you give. Write down the ways you’ve supported the people in your life and the times you might have fallen short. Contemplate how you could be doing more to show your loved ones you care –– whether that’s thoughtful messages or arranging time to talk in between busy days and weeks.
3) **Examine your overall connection to others**: Consider whether you feel supported in life or might be lacking meaningful connection. If you want to build new relationships in the new year, write down or seek out strategies for finding friends, pursuing dating, or building community.
